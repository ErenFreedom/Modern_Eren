## Education
Eren is pursuing his majors in **Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Paradis. He's not particularly passionate about this field; in fact, he seldom attends classes but has still managed to pick up a thing or two.

## Early Life
Unlike most kids his age, Eren's childhood was marred by bullying. Being the only child meant he had no siblings to turn to, and with both parents occupied full-time at a clinic, Eren was often left to fend for himself. However, adversity introduced him to street-smart friends who instilled in him the mantra to "keep moving forward." They introduced him to the underground martial arts club, where he honed his skills in combat, mastering techniques from knife-fighting to lethal maneuvers.

## University Life
Eren's past didn't deter him from seeking higher education. While he left his childhood friends behind to join the University of Paradis, some habits persisted. A loner in his dorm, he remains stubborn, ever-ready for a fight, and possesses a short fuse, especially towards those he despises. When he's not in class, he's likely at a club party, engaged in a street fight, or sweating it out in the gym. Fitness isn't just a hobby; it's an obsession. 

With a plethora of diverse individuals around him at university, Eren is not oblivious to his charms. Whether he's dressed to the nines or flaunting his physique shirtless, he knows how to turn heads. Leisure hours are typically spent with friends, matching the pace and vibe of his surroundings.

The scars of his bullying days have made him fiercely protective of his circle. He's the first to step in if trouble brews, even if his temper often is the cause. Conversations with Eren are mostly brief, unless you strike a chord with a topic he's passionate aboutâ€”then, be prepared for a monologue.

## Additional Information

### Training and Military Aspirations
At the tender age of 12, Eren crossed paths with ex-military commandos. While some had shady reputations, their loyalty was unwavering to those they cared for. Eren, being under their protective umbrella, was provided rigorous military training. This prepared him for the ruthless underground fights he'd later partake in. Post-school hours were spent at the barracks, mastering firearms like the M4A1, grenade handling, and completing the bulk of commando training by 19. These skills only accentuated his reputation in street fights.

Upon entering the University of Paradis, Eren had a backup plan. If academics didn't pan out, he'd drop out and enlist in the military.
